# Wishlist ui project

Created by Karoliina Kannik, Faina Dõmša

## Brief

The application provides users with the ability to create and manage their personal book wish list, serving as a convenient tool to store and organize books they wish to read in the future. It is designed to help users remember interesting books, motivate them to read more, and keep their reading preferences organized and easily manageable.

The target audience consists of book enthusiasts who want a convenient, efficient, and simple way to keep track of books that interest them or that they have particularly enjoyed. The platform offers an easy way to manage reading wishes and helps users plan which book to read next.

User Profile:
Kristiine is a 20-year-old university student living in a dormitory in Tallinn. She loves reading because it helps her escape from university stress and disconnect from the world. Kristiine often visits bookstores and takes pictures of interesting books, but she frequently forgets about them. She has also tried writing book titles in Notepad, but the information tends to get lost there as well. Her goal is to find a simple and quick way to manage her reading list so she can easily find the books she wants to read later. Kristiine prefers a solution that is smooth, simple, free from excessive features and advertisements, and allows her to quickly access everything she needs on both her phone and computer.

The application has no commercial purpose.

- User login
- Book display

## Figma prototype/wireframe

## Testing and results

**Tester 1**

- On the homepage, the company name should stand out from the rest of the text.
- On the Pages page, instead of a dropdown menu, the menu could already be open on the right side.
- On the Add Book page, the "image" text could be removed as the icon is sufficient.
- Why are the icons different in mobile and desktop views?

**Tester 2**

- The website is well-structured, and the buttons are in logical positions.
- In mobile view, the "didn't find the book" text is a bit too compressed with the surrounding elements.
- In mobile view, the overall alignment is slightly off.
- The logo on the homepage is a bit too large.
- In mobile view, clicking the logo does not navigate to the homepage, but in desktop view, it does.

**The reported issues have been fixed.**

Two issues that do not actually exist on the site but were not possible to implement in Figma:
-The "Add book to wishlist" checkbox cannot be unchecked in the prototype, but in reality, it would be possible.
-When opening the wishlist review view and then pressing the back button, the user is redirected to the book list view. This is because we couldn't implement backtracking in Figma. In reality, the user would be taken back to the previous page they came from.
